# Decentralized Staking and Reputation System

## Overview
A pair of Stacks blockchain smart contracts that implement a staking mechanism with a complementary reputation tracking system.

## Staking Contract

### Features
- Stake STX tokens
- Unstake tokens
- Slash (penalize) stakers
- Minimum stake requirement

### Key Functions
- `stake()`:
    - Deposit STX tokens into contract
    - Minimum 1 STX stake required
    - Tracks individual staker balances

- `unstake(amount)`:
    - Withdraw staked tokens
    - Limited to current staked balance

- `get-stake(staker)`:
    - Retrieve current stake for an address

- `slash(staker, amount)`:
    - Penalize stakers by reducing their stake
    - Useful for maintaining network integrity

## Reputation Contract

### Features
- Track user reputation
- Update reputation based on verification outcomes
- Calculate reputation score dynamically

### Key Functions
- `update-reputation(user, is-correct)`:
    - Increment/decrement reputation score
    - Track total and correct verifications
    - Adjusts score based on performance

- `get-reputation(user)`:
    - Retrieve current reputation metrics

## Error Handling
- Insufficient balance checks
- Unauthorized action prevention

## Reputation Scoring
- Dynamic scoring system
- Tracks:
    - Overall score
    - Total verifications
    - Correct verifications

## Potential Improvements
- Implement reward mechanisms
- More complex reputation calculation
- Time-based reputation decay
- Staking rewards
- Minimum reputation thresholds

## Use Cases
- Decentralized verification systems
- Network security
- Incentive alignment
- Reputation-based access control

## Security Considerations
- Stake slashing mechanism
- Basic access controls
- Transparent reputation tracking

## Deployment
Deploy on Stacks blockchain using Clarinet or similar development tools.
